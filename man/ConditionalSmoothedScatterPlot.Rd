\alias{ConditionalSmoothedScatterPlot}
\title{Plot a scatter plot with smoothing line, with smoothing window aligned either left, center or right,
      xvar is the continuous independent variable and yvar is the dependent binary variable.
      Smoothing is by a square window of width k}
\usage{
ConditionalSmoothedScatterPlot(frame, xvar, yvar, groupvar, title, ..., k = 3,
  align = "center")
}
\arguments{
\item{frame}{data frame to get values from}

\item{xvar}{name of the independent column in frame. Assumed to be regularly spaced}

\item{yvar}{name of the dependent (output or result to be modeled) column in frame}

\item{groupvar}{name of the grouping column in frame. Can be NULL for an unconditional plot}

\item{title}{title for plot}

\item{...}{no unnamed argument, added to force named binding of later arguments.}

\item{k}{width of smoothing window. Must be odd for a center-aligned plot. Defaults to 3}

\item{align}{smoothing window alignment: 'center', 'left', or 'right'. Defaults to 'center'}
}

\examples{

y = c(1,2,3,4,5,10,15,18,20,25)
x = seq_len(length(y))
df = data.frame(x=x,y=y)
WVPlots::ConditionalSmoothedScatterPlot(df, "x", "y", NULL,
   title="left smooth, one group", align="left")
